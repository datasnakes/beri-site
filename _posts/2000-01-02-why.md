#### _Are you a bioinformatician frustrated by R’s inability to resolve common dependency issues? Help develop [beRi](https://github.com/datasnakes/beRi), a package management, reproducible workflow, and installation toolkit for the R programming language._

R has many issues that stem from a lack of having proper management tools such as a project manager, a virtual environment manager, or a package manager. Many of the tools that are available are R packages, which makes it incredibly difficult to manage R from the command line. While Rstudio has developed a useful tool called packrat for managing projects, it still has performance issues including painfully long build times and poor integration with Bioconductor, one of the most widely used package repositories for R outside of CRAN. The task of building an R CLI is also a very daunting task even for advanced R users.

The project was initially conceptualized by [Robert Gilmore](https://github.com/grabear) with a little help from his colleague [Shaurita Hutchins](https://github.com/sdhutchins). Gilmore proposed the project to [hackseq18](https://www.hackseq.com/) where it was developed over 3 days by a great team of [developers](https://github.com/datasnakes/beRi#hackseq18-team-members). It ultimately went on to win **favorite project** by the hackseq18 participants.

### `beRi` is better

`beRi` is a set of Python packages which is composed of an R virtual environment manager ([renv](https://github.com/datasnakes/renv)), an R installation manager ([rinse](https://github.com/datasnakes/rinse)), and an R utility tool for installing packages, managing native R configuration files, and setting up local CRAN-like repositories ([rut](https://github.com/datasnakes/rut)). Since these packages/tools will be developed as standalone or fully independent CLI’s in separate repositories, beRi will integrate these packages and complement their functionalities in a separate CLI.
