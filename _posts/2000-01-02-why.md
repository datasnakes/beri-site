_Are you a biologist or bioinformatician who desires to manage R environments, install R, and install R packages using the command-line? Help develop [beRi](https://github.com/datasnakes/beRi)!_

### What is `beRi`?

beRi is a suite of Python packages composed of the following components: (1) [renv](https://github.com/datasnakes/renv), a virtual environment manager for R; [rinse](https://github.com/datasnakes/rinse), an R installation and R version manager; and (3) [rut](https://github.com/datasnakes/rut), an R utility tool for installing packages, managing native R configuration files, and setting up local CRAN-like repositories. These packages will be developed in separate repositories as standalone command-line interfaces (CLIs). [beRi](https://github.com/datasnakes/beRi) will also be developed in a separate repository but will depend on the other three packages.

These packages will be built in Python for Linux systems starting with the latest long-term support (LTS) Ubuntu release. We have opted to use Python because of the ease of developing CLIs with the powerful tooling available in Python compared to R or Bash. Specifically, we are using the [click](https://palletsprojects.com/p/click/) Python package to build the CLIs. We will optimize our Python packages for the R ecosystem by using the [R manuals](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/), which can be found on the CRAN website. Once we have achieved stable builds on Ubuntu, we will broaden our compatibility to include additional popular Linux distributions, Windows 7 and above, and macOS.

### Why `beRi`?

Reproducibility is one of the cornerstones of scientific advancement according to the [NIH](https://www.nih.gov/research-training/rigor-reproducibility). Organizations such as RStudio and rOpenSci promote these values, which makes R based data analysis increasingly more attractive. This is especially true in academia and in the health care industry, where R's popularity has created a demand for easy to use tools that improve reproducible research. Currently, several technologies exist that seek to accomplish this goal. The [containerit](https://github.com/o2r-project/containerit) and [rocker](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker) projects are examples that incorporate containerization via docker. The Docker strategy is a way to perfectly reproduce a project on any system. However, many R users in academia and in the health care industry usually don't have access to docker, primarily because of system [vulnerabilities](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/security/#docker-daemon-attack-surface), and because it typically requires administrative privileges. These issues are compounded in situations where system administrators are either inexperienced, overworked, or both. To ameliorate these issues, [conda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/tasks/use-r-language/) is the preferred framework and is by far one of the most popular options for reproducibility. In other use cases, researchers also prefer various R packages including [packrat](https://github.com/rstudio/packrat), [checkpoint](https://github.com/RevolutionAnalytics/checkpoint) (MRAN), [miniCRAN](https://github.com/andrie/miniCRAN), [drat](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/drat), [workflowr](https://github.com/jdblischak/workflowr), and [drake](https://github.com/ropensci/drake). While these packages add tremendous value to data analysis projects, they limit users to using an interactive R session (the R shell). The proposed solution is the beRi Suite of Tools for managing R. beRi is a recursive acronym, which stands for "beRi Environments for R Installations". The tools created for beRi will aim to support reproducibility by allowing virtualization and standardization for data analysis, while also supporting R's native infrastructure by developing command-line tools present in other popular programming languages.
